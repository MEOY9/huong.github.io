	<h1>Huong Vu, Graduate student in University of Maryland at College Park </h1>
	<p> I'm a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Dr. Thirumalai. My current PhD research focuses on developing models to analyze and interpret single molecule experiments, in order to discover new general principles of biological motors. I am interested in using both theoretical and computational tools to understand function and dynamics of such molecular machines.
