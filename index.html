	<h1>Huong Vu</h1>
	<h2>Graduate student in University of Maryland at College Park </h2>
	<p> I'm a biophysics PhD candidate under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/thirumalai">Thirumalai</a> (for his old group website, go <a href="http://biotheory.umd.edu/">here</a>.) 
		My current PhD research focuses on developing models to analyze and interpret single molecule experiments, in order to discover new general principles of biological motors. 
		I am interested in using both theoretical and computational tools to understand function and dynamics of such molecular machines.
